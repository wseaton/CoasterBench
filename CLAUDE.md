# OpenRCT2 Fork: Rust Agentic Eval Harness

This is a fork of OpenRCT2 (github.com/wseaton/OpenRCT2) with one goal: a Rust
plugin system that runs an agentic eval harness through the game. The flagship
eval: an LLM designs the best roller coaster, scored by in-game ratings.

## Fork rules

- We rebase onto upstream `develop` regularly. Almost all new code lives in new
  directories; edits to existing OpenRCT2 files must stay tiny and mechanical
  (single call sites, not refactors).
- New C++ files under `src/openrct2/` need no CMake edits (GLOB_RECURSE picks
  them up).

## Architecture

- Rust attaches as a **staticlib linked into the binary** (not dlopen, not IPC).
  Crate lives in `rust/orct2-agent`, bridged via cbindgen C ABI.
- C++ side of the bridge goes in `src/openrct2/rustbridge/` with a
  `NativeHookEngine` (the existing `scripting/HookEngine.h` Hook is
  QuickJS-specific and gated on ENABLE_SCRIPTING; we stay independent of it).
- Eval entry point: `openrct2-cli eval` command, modeled on
  `src/openrct2/command_line/SimulateCommands.cpp` (load park, tick N via
  `gameStateUpdateLogic()`, score).
- Mutations go through `GameActions::Execute` only, never direct game state
  pokes (same validation path as JS plugins).

## Key facts (verified in code)

- `gOpenRCT2Headless` and `gOpenRCT2NoGraphics` are separate flags. The eval
  command needs Headless=true, NoGraphics=false so the software renderer works:
  `CaptureImage()` (`src/openrct2/interface/Screenshot.cpp`) renders PNGs with
  no window/GPU, but asserts if sprite data wasn't loaded.
- Ride ratings hook site: `src/openrct2/ride/RideRatings.cpp` (~line 1076),
  next to the JS `rideRatingsCalculate` hook.
- Replay video = per-tick `CaptureImage` chase-cam frames (game logic is 40
  ticks/sec) + external ffmpeg encode in the harness. No video encoder in-tree,
  keep it that way.
- Determinism/repro: `ReplayManager.h`, `GameStateSnapshots.h` exist upstream.

## Rust bridge workflow

- ABI changes in `rust/orct2-agent/src/lib.rs` (any `#[no_mangle] extern "C"`
  item) require regenerating the checked-in header:
  `./scripts/generate-rust-header.sh` (needs `cargo install cbindgen`).
- Corrosion (pinned v0.6.1, FetchContent in `cmake/rustagent.cmake`) builds the
  crate; `ENABLE_RUST_AGENT` (default ON) gates everything, same pattern as
  ENABLE_SCRIPTING.
- Rust checks: `cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all --benches --tests --examples
  --all-features && cargo test` inside `rust/orct2-agent`.

## Build (macOS)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build
```

CMake auto-downloads prebuilt universal dylibs on macOS (MACOS_USE_DEPENDENCIES).
Note `LIBOPENRCT2_LINKAGE STATIC` on APPLE in `src/openrct2/CMakeLists.txt` (RTTI
across dylib boundary is broken on macOS, so libopenrct2 links static there).

## Running the CLI from the build dir

Non-bundled binaries look for `data/` next to the exe. One-time setup:
`ln -sf $PWD/build/OpenRCT2.app/Contents/Resources build/data`. Bare
`openrct2-cli` (launch mode) sets NoGraphics and works without RCT2 assets;
`simulate` (and our `eval`) load g1.dat and need the real game files.

## Eval workflow (phase 3+)

- Track programs: JSON (ride_type, start tile+dir, piece list) executed by
  `rust/orct2-agent/src/program.rs`; piece vocabulary in `pieces.rs` mirrors
  `src/openrct2/ride/ted/TrackElemType.h`. Example: `evals/programs/test_oval.json`.
- Full run: `./build/openrct2-cli eval <scenario> --ticks 25000
  --rct2-data-path ~/rct2-assets --program p.json --out report.json --capture park.png`
- Entrance/exit are brute-force auto-placed next to station tiles (game
  validation is the oracle). Testing status requires them.
- Direction semantics: dir 0 faces -x, 1 +y, 2 +x, 3 -y. Cursor z step 16.
- Stalls never get ratings (RatingsCalculationType::Stall); tracked rides need
  a completed test circuit (RideFlag::tested) before ratings compute.
- Head-to-head driver: `uv run evals/driver.py` (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or
  `--vertex` with GCP ADC; project defaults from $ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID);
  results under `evals/runs/<timestamp>/`. Models get a validate_track_program
  dry-run tool (placement + closure errors with a net-displacement hint) with
  a shared per-round budget alongside library lookups.
- Sub-lane orchestrator: `rust/coaster-bench` (own crate, not linked into the
  game). Spawns the game MCP server, then one sandboxed Claude Code session
  per model per round (OpenShell sandbox `coaster-sub`, personal-sub OAuth via
  the `claude-sub` provider) building interactively through the MCP tools;
  collects report/program/park.png per round into the same evals/runs layout.
  `./rust/coaster-bench/target/release/coaster-bench --models claude-fable-5
  --rounds 4 --ride-type 51 --name my-run`. Port must be in the sandbox
  policy (default 8791).
- Second coaster-bench lane: `--models opencode:openrouter/<author>/<model>`
  runs opencode in the `coaster-or` sandbox against OpenRouter (key in the
  login keychain as `openrouter-api-key`, cost tracked by spend delta).
  coaster-bench writes that sandbox's ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json per
  session, so the MCP endpoint is per contender. Model input modalities come
  from the OpenRouter catalogue and are recorded in run.json; a text-only
  model gets `?modalities=text` and a prompt with no screenshot tool.
- Two driver modes (`--mode`, recorded in run.json + standings.json, separate
  leaderboard sections in the site): `design` (from scratch) and `library`
  (model can search the stock .TD6 library via extra tools; tests retrieval +
  adaptation). Both modes penalize similarity to stock designs: report.json
  carries the nearest-design similarity (edit distance + longest common
  substring, mirrored variants included; rust similarity.rs), and scores scale
  linearly to zero above the grace threshold (driver's SIMILARITY_GRACE,
  recorded per run in run.json; site reads it from there). Library JSON dump:
  `openrct2-cli eval <scenario> --rct2-data-path ... --dump-library lib.json`;
  preview PNGs (game's own TrackDesignDrawPreview, 370x217, needs a park
  loaded): `... --render-library <dir>`, cached at evals/library-previews/
  (gitignored, auto-rendered by the driver in library mode).
- Library lookups are persisted per round as `round_N/lookups.json` (written
  by driver.py, but any harness can drop the same file); the site shows
  per-round lookup chips, a "studied designs" preview gallery per model, and
  a full library.html gallery.
- Heavy artifacts (PNGs, videos) are gitignored, not tracked; only run JSON
  is. After a run, `uv run evals/publish.py` uploads them to the Cloudflare
  R2 bucket `coasterbench` (public at https://artifacts.wseaton.com) through
  the local `wrangler login` OAuth session (no static keys anywhere) and
  records manifests (`runs/<run>/artifacts.json`, `evals/library-previews.json`).
  The SSG prefers local files, falls back to manifest URLs, so the GitHub
  Pages CI build works from JSON alone. **Both must be committed and pushed**
  or the deployed site renders with no images at all.

## Site generator (rust/coaster-site)

- `cargo run --manifest-path rust/coaster-site/Cargo.toml` writes `evals/site/`
  (own crate, askama templates in `templates/`, CSS/JS in `static/`, raster
  work — index thumbnails, og-card, favicon — via the `image` crate). This is
  what the Pages workflow builds; `evals/site.py` is the superseded Python
  version, kept until the Rust output has a few deploys behind it.
- Index table is one row per model per run (runs pivoted), grouped by run and
  faceted by mode/coaster/harness/model.
- Runs that never finished are skipped, with the reason on stderr and a note
  on the page: any model short of run.json's promised `models`/`rounds` (or,
  for runs from before run.json recorded them, short of the run's own best
  round count). `--include-partial` renders them anyway.

## MCP server (interactive per-piece building)

- `./build/openrct2-cli eval <scenario> --rct2-data-path ~/rct2-assets
  --serve 8791` runs an MCP server at `http://127.0.0.1:8791/mcp`
  (streamable HTTP, JSON response mode).
- Hand-rolled sync server in `rust/orct2-agent/src/mcp.rs` — runs ON the game
  thread by design (game API is single-threaded); rmcp/tokio deliberately
  avoided. Tools: new_ride, place_piece, place_pieces (batch placement, max 200
  pieces), valid_next_pieces (game-as-oracle query of the whole catalog),
  get_state, finish_and_test, screenshot (MCP image content), demolish,
  search_track_designs + get_track_design (stock .TD6 library browsing;
  recorded ratings deliberately hidden).
- Cursor state now tracks bank (TrackRoll: 0=none, 2=left, 4=right, 15=upside_down)
  and slope (TrackPitch: 0=none, 2=up25, 4=up60, 6=down25, 8=down60); circuit
  closure check compares full cursor (x/y/z/dir/bank/slope) to catch incomplete
  circuits that re-enter the station still banked or sloped.
- Clients advertise what content they can take in the request target:
  `/mcp?modalities=text,image` (vocabulary lifted from OpenRouter's
  `input_modalities`; absent = everything). Tools answering outside the set are
  dropped from tools/list and refused on call, so a text-only model never sees
  screenshot — one image content block fails the whole upstream request
  (Poolside answers "please check the model you provided").
- Register with Claude Code:
  `claude mcp add --transport http coaster http://127.0.0.1:8791/mcp`
- Rust unit tests link against `#[cfg(test)]` stubs in host.rs (the C++ host
  only exists in the game binary); game behavior is tested e2e via the CLI.

## OpenShell sandbox harness (containerized Claude Code + one MCP)

Docs live in ~/git/OpenShell/docs — READ THEM before changing anything here.
- Gateway: `openshell-gateway --config ~/.config/openshell/gateway.toml`
  (podman driver). Client mTLS certs live in
  ~/.config/openshell/gateways/<name>/mtls and must match the server PKI in
  ~/.local/state/openshell/tls (copy ca.crt + client/tls.* on BadSignature).
- Sandbox image (scratchpad/coaster-sandbox/Dockerfile): node:22-slim +
  iproute2 (required for netns isolation) + `useradd sandbox` (required by
  installed 0.0.88; newer versions accept bare UIDs). Image CMD is replaced by
  the supervisor — pass start commands via `-- <cmd>` or `sandbox exec`.
- Game server must bind 0.0.0.0 (`--serve-bind 0.0.0.0`); sandboxes reach the
  host at host.containers.internal.
- Policy (scratchpad/coaster-sandbox/policy.yaml): vertex endpoints + game MCP
  only. Binary attribution uses kernel-resolved paths — Claude Code 2.x is
  `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/bin/claude.exe`, not
  node. Denials log to `openshell logs <sandbox>` with binary + reason.
- Inference: gateway-managed vertex provider (`--from-gcloud-adc` +
  VERTEX_AI_PROJECT_ID/REGION/PUBLISHER config). inference.local rejects
  Claude Code's `context_management` param (Vertex schema), so the working
  path is Claude Code vertex mode + placeholder substitution:
  `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1 CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1
  ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="$GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_TOKEN"` — the proxy resolves the
  placeholder to the gateway-minted token at egress; no real creds in sandbox.

## Runtime assets

RCT2 asset files are required at **runtime** (even headless park loading), not
compile time. Source: GOG installer + innoextract (preferred on macOS) or RCT
Classic. Point `general.game_path` in the OpenRCT2 config at them.
