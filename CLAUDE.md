# OpenRCT2 Fork: Rust Agentic Eval Harness

This is a fork of OpenRCT2 (github.com/wseaton/OpenRCT2) with one goal: a Rust
plugin system that runs an agentic eval harness through the game. The flagship
eval: an LLM designs the best roller coaster, scored by in-game ratings.

## Fork rules

- We rebase onto upstream `develop` regularly. Almost all new code lives in new
  directories; edits to existing OpenRCT2 files must stay tiny and mechanical
  (single call sites, not refactors).
- New C++ files under `src/openrct2/` need no CMake edits (GLOB_RECURSE picks
  them up).

## Architecture

- Rust attaches as a **staticlib linked into the binary** (not dlopen, not IPC).
  Crate lives in `rust/orct2-agent`, bridged via cbindgen C ABI.
- C++ side of the bridge goes in `src/openrct2/rustbridge/` with a
  `NativeHookEngine` (the existing `scripting/HookEngine.h` Hook is
  QuickJS-specific and gated on ENABLE_SCRIPTING; we stay independent of it).
- Eval entry point: `coasterbench-cli eval` command, modeled on
  `src/openrct2/command_line/SimulateCommands.cpp` (load park, tick N via
  `gameStateUpdateLogic()`, score).
- Mutations go through `GameActions::Execute` only, never direct game state
  pokes (same validation path as JS plugins).

## Key facts (verified in code)

- `gOpenRCT2Headless` and `gOpenRCT2NoGraphics` are separate flags. The eval
  command needs Headless=true, NoGraphics=false so the software renderer works:
  `CaptureImage()` (`src/openrct2/interface/Screenshot.cpp`) renders PNGs with
  no window/GPU, but asserts if sprite data wasn't loaded.
- Ride ratings hook site: `src/openrct2/ride/RideRatings.cpp` (~line 1076),
  next to the JS `rideRatingsCalculate` hook.
- Replay video = fixed-camera frames + external ffmpeg encode in the harness.
  No video encoder in-tree, keep it that way. The camera is the track's
  bounding box (the same crop as park.png) and never moves, so consecutive
  frames differ only where the train is, which is what makes the encode cheap.
  A chase cam would move every pixel and defeat that.
- Determinism/repro: `ReplayManager.h`, `GameStateSnapshots.h` exist upstream.

## Rust bridge workflow

- ABI changes in `rust/orct2-agent/src/lib.rs` (any `#[no_mangle] extern "C"`
  item) require regenerating the checked-in header:
  `./scripts/generate-rust-header.sh` (needs `cargo install cbindgen`).
- Corrosion (pinned v0.6.1, FetchContent in `cmake/rustagent.cmake`) builds the
  crate; `ENABLE_RUST_AGENT` (default ON) gates everything, same pattern as
  ENABLE_SCRIPTING.
- Rust checks: `cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all --benches --tests --examples
  --all-features && cargo test` inside `rust/orct2-agent`.

## Build (macOS)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build
```

CMake auto-downloads prebuilt universal dylibs on macOS (MACOS_USE_DEPENDENCIES).
Note `LIBOPENRCT2_LINKAGE STATIC` on APPLE in `src/openrct2/CMakeLists.txt` (RTTI
across dylib boundary is broken on macOS, so libopenrct2 links static there).

## Running the CLI from the build dir

Non-bundled binaries look for `data/` next to the exe. One-time setup:
`ln -sf $PWD/build/OpenRCT2.app/Contents/Resources build/data`. Bare
`coasterbench-cli` (launch mode) sets NoGraphics and works without RCT2 assets;
`simulate` (and our `eval`) load g1.dat and need the real game files.

## Eval workflow (phase 3+)

- Track programs: JSON (ride_type, start tile+dir, piece list) executed by
  `rust/orct2-agent/src/program.rs`; piece vocabulary in `pieces.rs` mirrors
  `src/openrct2/ride/ted/TrackElemType.h`. Example: `evals/programs/test_oval.json`.
- One piece format everywhere: `pieces::PieceSpec` parses a bare name, a raw
  TrackElemType id, or `{"t"|"piece": name, "chain": bool, "speed": 0-30}`, and
  both the program executor and place_pieces use it. Programs used to take only
  `t` and place_pieces only `piece`, while the lists the server hands back
  (get_state, placed_pieces, the eval report) are in program form, so replaying
  a session's own batch needed hand translation. It doesn't now: a place_pieces
  array copied out of a trace runs as a program unchanged, which is how the
  loop-under-lift retest was done.
- Full run: `./build/coasterbench-cli eval <scenario> --ticks 25000
  --rct2-data-path ~/rct2-assets --program p.json --out report.json --capture park.png`
- Entrance/exit are brute-force auto-placed next to station tiles (game
  validation is the oracle). Testing status requires them.
- Direction semantics: dir 0 faces -x, 1 +y, 2 +x, 3 -y. Cursor z step 16.
- Placement is NOT a sufficient oracle for drawability: TrackPlaceAction never
  checks the ride's enabled track groups (that gate only feeds the construction
  window), so pieces the ride style has no artwork for build and rate fine and
  render as nothing (wooden RC + 1-tile flat<->60 transitions is the classic
  case). `CheckPieceDrawable` in RustBridge.cpp gates place and query against
  the renderer's own dispatch (GetTrackPaintFunction vs TrackPaintFunctionDummy).
  See issue #1 and the readme implementation notes.
- Stalls never get ratings (RatingsCalculationType::Stall); tracked rides need
  a completed test circuit (RideFlag::tested) before ratings compute.
- Brake/booster speed is a per-element property (0-30, `kMaximumTrackSpeed`)
  that only brakes and boosters read: brakes decelerate a train to it, a
  booster accelerates up to it and does nothing at all when its speed does not
  exceed the train's. Pieces take an optional `speed` in the same object form
  as `chain` (`{"t": "booster", "speed": 20}`), in place_piece, place_pieces and
  track programs; absent means 8, which is what the construction window gives a
  player (`_currentBrakeSpeed`). It is refused on pieces that ignore it rather
  than stored and forgotten, and it round-trips through placed_pieces so a
  replayed program is the same ride.
  - Until 2026-07-25 the bridge hardcoded brakeSpeed 0 on every placement, so
    every booster an agent placed was inert and every brake was a full stop.
    Measured on the test oval: a speed-0 booster gives 56s/0.12 excitement,
    identical to no booster; at speed 25 the same circuit is 12s/0.27. Runs
    before that commit are not comparable on any track using either piece.
  - Twister (51) has `booster` in its enabledTrackGroups; wooden (52) has it
    only in extraTrackGroups, so the game's own construction window hides it
    behind the extra-elements toggle. TrackPlaceAction never checks those
    groups (see the drawability note above), and boosters are deliberately
    allowed on both here: the 56s->12s measurement above is ride_type 52.
  - The round prompt names the piece and its speed syntax for both ride types.
    Before that it was only discoverable through a valid_next_pieces catalog
    dump, and in eleven rounds exactly one agent (opus-5, opennote round 6)
    ever tried a booster. It used three to fix a valleying loop, got
    tested:false because they were inert, concluded "boosters are NOT a
    sufficient energy fix" and wrote that into its notes. The bug did not cost
    a score; it suppressed a strategy.
- Save-park artifact: `coasterbench-cli eval ... --save-park <path>` writes a
  .park (~55 KB) after the tick loop, and coaster-bench collects one per round
  as `round_N/park.park`. Round-trip verified: reloading a saved park gives the
  same ride, rating and circuit audit. Both paths go through
  `RustBridge::SavePark`, which packs the loaded objects the way the crash
  handler's save does, so a park using non-standard objects still reopens.
  - `save_park` writes a host filesystem path, so it lives on the loopback
    control listener only (see the MCP section), never in the agent toolset.
    `best: true` writes the exact serialized park captured with the winning
    adjusted-score report, even if the live ride was later rebuilt.
  - `evals/runs/**/*.park` is gitignored like the other heavy artifacts and
    published to R2 by `evals/publish.py`; its full SHA-256 is recorded in the
    per-run digest manifest and the site links it for verification.
- Replay video: the control tool
  `capture_replay(out, frames, every_ticks, zoom, best)`
  renders frames straight into an ffmpeg it spawns (rawvideo rgba on stdin ->
  libx264, crf 28, `-g` = frame count so the clip has a single keyframe),
  writing `round_N/replay.mp4` with no intermediate files at all. Off with
  `--replay-seconds 0`. Filming lives in `rust/orct2-agent/src/replay.rs` and has
  two callers: that tool, and `coasterbench-cli eval --replay <path>
  [--replay-seconds N]`, which is how a round from before videos existed gets
  one (see backfill below).
  - It also writes `round_N/replay.png`, a still from the same camera, which is
    the video's poster on the site. The round's park.png frames the whole map,
    so using it left an island in front of a clip framed to the track: the
    coaster was a squiggle in the middle until the moment you pressed play.
  - `CaptureImageToBuffer` (a fork-only addition beside `CaptureImage` in
    Screenshot.cpp) renders to RGBA instead of writing a PNG; the palette
    lookup is the whole conversion, since the software renderer works in 8-bit
    indices. `orct2_host_capture_size` gives the frame size up front so one
    buffer serves the whole replay.
  - Filming starts when the lead train's `Vehicle::Status` reaches `departing`,
    so a clip opens on a station departure rather than mid-circuit. It gives up
    after 120s of game time: a valleyed train never departs, and that footage
    is exactly the footage worth having.
  - Length is one whole station-to-station cycle: filming starts at the lead
    train's `departing` and ends at its next `departing`, so the last frame runs
    into the first and the clip loops seamlessly. Verified by diffing them: 123
    differing pixels out of 195k, and that residue is guests walking and water
    shimmering, not the train. The cycle includes the dwell in the station,
    because the ride's cycle does.
  - `--replay-seconds` (90 default) is only the bound for a train that never
    comes back round: a valleyed circuit, or a lap longer than the cap. Those
    clips are excerpts, and `round_N/replay.json` records `looped: false` so the
    site can leave the `loop` attribute off rather than jump forever. 8 of the
    11 backfilled clips loop; the three that do not are the giant library
    coasters, and the 6.3 km one had not come back round after five minutes of
    filming. It used to be `ride_time` + a 3s tail, which is exactly what put
    the train mid-track when the video restarted it at the station.
  - Frame size follows the track's footprint, so numbers vary a lot: the test
    oval crops to 672x432, the 7.39 record coaster to 2016x1552. Measured on
    the latter, 1280 frames (64s): PNG frames cost 40 ms each, 51s in total and
    269 MB on disk; piping raw costs 6 ms each and 7.8s, with no disk at all.
    That is 8.2x realtime, against ~1031x realtime for the simulation itself
    (25000 ticks in 0.61s), so filming remains the slow half by far.
  - ffmpeg comes from brew and is not vendored; a missing binary logs and skips
    the video rather than failing the round.
- Backfilling artifacts: `uv run evals/backfill_replays.py` reruns a round's
  program.json to refilm it and re-render `park.png` cropped (best round per
  model by default; `--all` for every round, `--no-replay` for pictures only,
  which is seconds per round instead of tens).
  - Reproduction is checked, not assumed, and the two artifacts are held to
    different bars because they show different things. The **video** needs the
    excitement to match the round's own: a clip shows the train moving, and
    motion is exactly what changes when an inert booster starts working. The
    **picture** only needs the program to build in full: a still shows track,
    and the same piece list draws the same track. A program that does not build
    writes neither. On the current build 11 of 23 best rounds reproduce exactly,
    and 85 of 138 rounds redraw.
  - Three reasons a rerun rates differently, all of them worth knowing
    independently of artifacts: brake/booster speed used to be hardcoded to 0
    (see the booster note above), so any track using them now rates differently;
    `CheckPieceDrawable` postdates the older wooden runs, so some programs are
    legitimately refused now; and the oldest recorded programs are bare
    piece-name strings with no chain flags, so their lift hills do not lift. A
    program.json from those runs is not a faithful record of its ride.
- Circuit audit: `orct2_host_circuit_stats` walks a ride with the game's own
  TrackCircuitIterator (what findTrackGap uses), seeded from the station origin
  element, and report.json gains per-ride
  `circuit: {walked_pieces, total_pieces, orphan_pieces, looped}`. Ratings only
  witness that the ridden loop closes and completes, so orphans (track placed
  but joined to nothing) are the gap this closes; the site shows a green
  "verified circuit" chip at 0 orphans, amber otherwise.
  - Only sequence-0 elements count on both sides. A multi-tile piece has an
    element per tile but the walk visits it once, so counting raw elements
    invents orphans.
  - The walk starts at the station's *departure* element and runs forward, so
    an unclosed track needs the backward sweep too, otherwise the pieces behind
    the station read as stranded (a plain station + straight measured 6 of 8).
  - Verified live: closed oval 16/16/0 looped, open track 14/14/0 not looped,
    station+straight 8/8/0. The orphan>0 path has no live repro (the executor
    no longer strands track), only unit coverage in coaster-site.
- Head-to-head driver: `uv run evals/driver.py` (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or
  `--vertex` with GCP ADC; project defaults from $ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID);
  results under `evals/runs/<timestamp>/`. Models get a validate_track_program
  dry-run tool (placement + closure errors with a net-displacement hint) with
  a shared per-round budget alongside library lookups.
- Sub-lane orchestrator: `rust/coaster-bench` (own crate, not linked into the
  game). Spawns the game MCP server, then one sandboxed Claude Code session
  per model per round (OpenShell sandbox `coaster-sub`, personal-sub OAuth via
  the `claude-sub` provider) building interactively through the MCP tools;
  collects report/program/park.png per round into the same evals/runs layout.
  `./rust/coaster-bench/target/release/coaster-bench --models claude-fable-5
  --mode design --rounds 4 --ride-type 51 --name my-run`. `design` hides and
  refuses stock-library lookup tools; `library` explicitly grants them;
  `open-note` is the white-box source condition. Port must be in the sandbox
  policy (default 8791). `--mode open-note` stages upstream's tree (git archive of
  `git merge-base HEAD origin/develop`, cached under $TMPDIR by revision) into
  the sandbox at /tmp/openrct2-src via `openshell sandbox upload`
  (exec stdin caps at 4 MiB; upload nests the local dir under its dest, so the
  staging dir is named openrct2-src and uploaded to /tmp), then chmod -R a-w.
  `--fresh-sandbox` creates `<base>-<hex id>` per run from
  rust/coaster-bench/sandbox/{Dockerfile,policy.yaml} (recovered 2026-07-25 from
  the running image; the originals were lost) and deletes it on the way out, so
  no agent state survives a run. Gateway caps sandbox names at 19 chars;
  `sandbox create` attaches and never returns, but the sandbox outlives the
  client, so the harness spawns it, polls readiness, then drops the client.
  `sandbox exec` stdin caps at 4 MiB and deletes are eventually consistent.
  SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP set a flag (signal-hook) that the round loop and the
  session poll loop check, so the agent is killed, the sandbox swept and the
  game server dropped instead of orphaned; a run refuses to start if its port
  is already serving (use --attach deliberately).
  Records the exact condition, capabilities, harness/scorer version, source and
  scenario hashes, budgets, image ids, model/agent versions, and reset strategy
  in run.json. RideRatings.cpp is unmodified in this fork, so upstream source
  is a faithful oracle for scoring.
- `--resume <run-dir>` continues a run that died partway instead of losing the
  rounds it did finish: each model picks up at its first missing round (counted
  as the unbroken prefix of rounds holding both `report.json` and `park.png`, the latter written last so a round that died collecting does not count), carrying the archived best
  score and the previous round's report as feedback, so the winner survives the
  gap and the next prompt still quotes the round before it. Raise `--rounds` to
  add more. An unrated round counts as done, because it had its turn and its
  logs are the evidence of what went wrong; delete a round directory to have it
  built again. Condition, ride type and lineup must match or it refuses, since
  mixing those in one standings table would corrupt the record. run.json grows a
  `segments` array, one entry per time someone pressed go (harness version,
  commit, image ids, first round per model): a continued run is built by more
  than one harness build, and a single source field would claim rounds it never
  produced. Runs from before this gain a synthesized first segment.
- Second coaster-bench lane: `--models opencode:openrouter/<author>/<model>`
  runs opencode in the `coaster-or` sandbox against OpenRouter (key in the
  login keychain as `openrouter-api-key`, cost tracked by spend delta).
  coaster-bench writes that sandbox's ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json per
  session, so the MCP endpoint is per contender. Model input modalities come
  from the OpenRouter catalogue and are recorded in run.json; a text-only
  model gets `?modalities=text` and a prompt with no screenshot tool.
- Third coaster-bench lane: `--models codex:<model>` runs codex in the
  `codex-arena` sandbox on the ChatGPT subscription (`codex-oauth` provider),
  and `--models codex:openrouter/<author>/<model>` runs the same harness against
  OpenRouter instead. coaster-bench writes `$CODEX_HOME` (config.toml, and
  auth.json on the subscription backend) per session, so the MCP endpoint,
  model and credentials are all per contender.
  - `$HOME` is `/sandbox` in that image, not `/home/sandbox` like the other two
    lanes, and codex refuses a CODEX_HOME under /tmp. Keep the paths
    `$HOME`-relative.
  - Auth: the gateway injects `CODEX_AUTH_*` as `openshell:` placeholders the
    egress proxy substitutes. The access and refresh tokens stay placeholders;
    the id token and account id are copied from the host's `~/.codex/auth.json`,
    because codex decodes the JWT locally ("invalid ID token format" otherwise).
    `last_refresh` is stamped at session start so codex never tries a refresh,
    which would write a real token into the sandbox.
  - Codex has no per-tool allowlist, so open note reaches it as
    `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` (OpenShell is the real jail) versus
    `read-only` for a blind run, recorded as `codex_sandbox_mode` in run.json.
    A blind codex round still has a shell, unlike the other two lanes.
    The trusted coaster MCP server is configured with
    `default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"`; without it, headless
    `codex exec` cancels every tool call because no user-input handler exists
    to answer the approval prompt.
  - `--codex-reasoning-effort` is pinned to `medium` by default and recorded
    both per contender and at the run level. Never rely on the model catalogue
    default for a published comparison.
  - Reasoning in traces: codex assumes an unknown model slug cannot reason and
    then never requests reasoning summaries, so `model_reasoning_summary =
    "auto"` is set unconditionally in the generated config (the published
    gpt-5.6-sol run predates that and traced zero reasoning). Separately,
    `codex exec --json` only builds reasoning items from OpenAI-style *summary*
    parts; kimi-k3's reasoning comes back from OpenRouter with an empty summary
    and the text under `content` (`reasoning_text`), so kimi-on-codex traces
    have no thinking events even though the model reasons. No config flag fixes
    that (`show_raw_agent_reasoning` and `model_supports_reasoning_summaries`
    verified to not change the --json stream); the text only exists in the
    session rollout jsonl under `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/**`, which the harness
    deliberately does not collect. Known gap, not a silent model behavior.
  - The OpenRouter backend needs `wire_api = "responses"` (codex 0.145 dropped
    "chat") and needs `/home/sandbox/bin/codex` in the *openrouter provider
    profile's* binary list: a provider-injected policy owns its own hosts, so
    `codex-policy.yaml` cannot grant openrouter.ai on its own. The edited
    profile is checked in at `rust/coaster-bench/sandbox/openrouter-profile.yaml`.
  - Build the image for the host arch (`podman build --platform linux/arm64`):
    the OpenShell base is multi-arch, and an amd64 image under Rosetta dies at
    sandbox start with "Unable to open /proc/self/exe".
  - Cheap smoke of the whole lane (one round, dollars not cents):
    `--models codex:openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini --rounds 1 --open-note
    --fresh-sandbox --name codex-smoke`. Model support for codex's built-in
    tools varies on OpenRouter and shows up as a 400 on the first turn:
    gpt-5-nano and gpt-5-mini negotiate the toolset, gpt-5.4-nano refuses
    (`Tool 'tool_search' is not supported`). The subscription lane can be
    smoked for free while quota is out (`--models codex:gpt-5.6-sol
    --codex-sandbox codex-arena`): reaching the usage-limit error proves the
    auth file and egress substitution worked.
- Two driver modes (`--mode`, recorded in run.json + standings.json, separate
  leaderboard sections in the site): `design` (from scratch) and `library`
  (model can search the stock .TD6 library via extra tools; tests retrieval +
  adaptation). Both modes penalize similarity to stock designs: report.json
  carries the nearest-design similarity (edit distance + longest common
  substring, mirrored variants included; rust similarity.rs), and scores scale
  linearly to zero above the grace threshold (driver's SIMILARITY_GRACE,
  recorded per run in run.json; site reads it from there). Library JSON dump:
  `coasterbench-cli eval <scenario> --rct2-data-path ... --dump-library lib.json`;
  preview PNGs (game's own TrackDesignDrawPreview, 370x217, needs a park
  loaded): `... --render-library <dir>`, cached at evals/library-previews/
  (gitignored, auto-rendered by the driver in library mode).
- Library lookups are persisted per round as `round_N/lookups.json` (written
  by driver.py, but any harness can drop the same file); the site shows
  per-round lookup chips, a "studied designs" preview gallery per model, and
  a full library.html gallery.

## MCP server (interactive per-piece building)

- `./build/coasterbench-cli eval <scenario> --rct2-data-path ~/rct2-assets
  --serve 8791` runs an MCP server at `http://127.0.0.1:8791/mcp`
  (streamable HTTP, JSON response mode).
- Hand-rolled server in `rust/orct2-agent/src/mcp.rs`, no async runtime. Socket
  I/O runs on a thread per connection; every request crosses one mpsc channel to
  the game thread, which owns the session and is the only thread that may call
  `host::*` (the logger included, so connection threads never log). Requests
  still execute serially in arrival order, so determinism is unchanged. Before
  this the accept loop lived on the game thread and a client that connected then
  went silent hung the server for everyone.
- Two listeners, and the one a request arrives on chooses its tool table:
  `--serve` (bind 0.0.0.0 for the sandboxes) serves the agent tools, and
  `--serve-control <port>` binds 127.0.0.1 only and serves the harness's tools
  (`reset_park`, `save_park`, `capture_park`, `capture_replay`). A control tool is therefore
  absent from the agent's table rather than filtered out of it, and the listener
  is not routable from a container at all. coaster-bench defaults to
  `--control-port 8792` and collects every round artifact over it. The control
  listener is loopback-only and bypasses agent leases; stale leases are still
  rejected on the sandbox-facing listener.
  The agent's `screenshot` renders the *whole map* on purpose (an agent needs
  spatial context, not a viewport); the round's picture comes from
  `capture_park(path, best)`, which crops to the track. The server snapshots
  the pristine scenario before opening either listener; `reset_park` restores
  those exact serialized bytes before every round, including clock, RNG,
  guests and weather.
  coaster-bench used to
  keep the agent's screenshot as `round_N/park.png`, which is why older rounds
  are 9728x5008 pictures of an island with a coaster-shaped squiggle in the
  middle. `best: true` writes the park as it stood when the best rated test was
  taken (stashed beside the agent-facing one), so demolishing a scored coaster
  does not lose its picture. The best candidate is selected by adjusted score,
  not raw excitement, and atomically owns its report, program state, park bytes,
  screenshots and replay source. `style_best_ride` is deliberately non-scoring:
  after a model banks a result it can name that saved winner and choose the
  main-track, rail and support colours. The server temporarily restores the
  winner, applies ordinary ride game actions, refreshes its park/screenshots,
  then restores the live work-in-progress; ratings and score stay unchanged.
  That presentation follows a later candidate if it beats the styled winner.
  A completed result can receive the same pass through
  `coaster-bench --present-round evals/runs/<run>/<model>/round_<N>`. It
  reconstructs and score-checks the archived program before invoking the
  original model under `condition=presentation`, where the server exposes only
  `best_result`, `best_screenshot` and `style_best_ride`. Park, picture and
  replay are staged before replacement, while
  `presentation/{trace.jsonl,usage.json,pass.json}` preserves the post-hoc turn
  and artifact hashes separately from the scoring transcript.
  Tools: new_ride, place_piece, place_pieces (batch placement, max 200
  pieces), valid_next_pieces (game-as-oracle query of the whole catalog),
  get_state, finish_and_test, style_best_ride, screenshot (MCP image content), demolish,
  search_track_designs + get_track_design (stock .TD6 library browsing;
  recorded ratings deliberately hidden). Those two tools are absent and
  refused for `condition=design`, and available only for `condition=library`.
- Cursor state now tracks bank (TrackRoll: 0=none, 2=left, 4=right, 15=upside_down)
  and slope (TrackPitch: 0=none, 2=up25, 4=up60, 6=down25, 8=down60); circuit
  closure check compares full cursor (x/y/z/dir/bank/slope) to catch incomplete
  circuits that re-enter the station still banked or sloped.
- Clients advertise what content they can take in the request target:
  `/mcp?modalities=text,image` (vocabulary lifted from OpenRouter's
  `input_modalities`; absent = everything). Tools answering outside the set are
  dropped from tools/list and refused on call, so a text-only model never sees
  screenshot — one image content block fails the whole upstream request
  (Poolside answers "please check the model you provided").
- Clients also advertise the benchmark condition as `condition=design` or
  `condition=library`; absent and unknown values default to design.
- Register with Claude Code:
  `claude mcp add --transport http coaster http://127.0.0.1:8791/mcp`
- Rust unit tests link against `#[cfg(test)]` stubs in host.rs (the C++ host
  only exists in the game binary); game behavior is tested e2e via the CLI.

## OpenShell sandbox harness (containerized Claude Code + one MCP)

Docs live in ~/git/OpenShell/docs — READ THEM before changing anything here.
- Gateway: `openshell-gateway --config ~/.config/openshell/gateway.toml`
  (podman driver). Client mTLS certs live in
  ~/.config/openshell/gateways/<name>/mtls and must match the server PKI in
  ~/.local/state/openshell/tls (copy ca.crt + client/tls.* on BadSignature).
- Sandbox image (scratchpad/coaster-sandbox/Dockerfile): node:22-slim +
  iproute2 (required for netns isolation) + `useradd sandbox` (required by
  installed 0.0.88; newer versions accept bare UIDs). Image CMD is replaced by
  the supervisor — pass start commands via `-- <cmd>` or `sandbox exec`.
- Game server must bind 0.0.0.0 (`--serve-bind 0.0.0.0`); sandboxes reach the
  host at host.containers.internal.
- Policy (scratchpad/coaster-sandbox/policy.yaml): vertex endpoints + game MCP
  only. Binary attribution uses kernel-resolved paths — Claude Code 2.x is
  `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/bin/claude.exe`, not
  node. Denials log to `openshell logs <sandbox>` with binary + reason.
- Inference: gateway-managed vertex provider (`--from-gcloud-adc` +
  VERTEX_AI_PROJECT_ID/REGION/PUBLISHER config). inference.local rejects
  Claude Code's `context_management` param (Vertex schema), so the working
  path is Claude Code vertex mode + placeholder substitution:
  `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1 CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1
  ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="$GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_TOKEN"` — the proxy resolves the
  placeholder to the gateway-minted token at egress; no real creds in sandbox.

## Runtime assets

RCT2 asset files are required at **runtime** (even headless park loading), not
compile time. Source: GOG installer + innoextract (preferred on macOS) or RCT
Classic. Point `general.game_path` in the OpenRCT2 config at them.
