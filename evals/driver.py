"""Coaster design head-to-head: two Claude models iteratively design a coaster.

Each round the model submits a JSON track program (via forced tool use); the
harness runs `openrct2-cli eval` on a fresh copy of the scenario, then feeds
back the eval report and a park screenshot. Best excitement across rounds wins.

Two modes:
  design  (default) — the model designs from scratch; pure design ability.
  library — the model can additionally search the stock RCT2 track design
            library and read full piece sequences; tests information retrieval
            and adaptation. Scores are penalized for similarity to any stock
            design (mirrored copies included), so copying outright scores zero.

Usage (first-party API):
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... uv run evals/driver.py \
      --models claude-fable-5 claude-sonnet-5 --rounds 4 --mode library

Usage (Google Vertex AI; auth via `gcloud auth application-default login`):
  uv run evals/driver.py --vertex --project my-gcp-project \
      --models claude-opus-4-6 claude-sonnet-5 --rounds 4

Vertex model IDs for current-generation models are the bare first-party
strings (claude-opus-4-6, claude-sonnet-5) — no prefix, no @date suffix.

Usage (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, e.g. a local vLLM server):
  vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct --enable-auto-tool-choice ...
  uv run evals/driver.py --base-url http://localhost:8000/v1 \
      --models Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct --rounds 4 --no-graphics

--no-graphics runs the game without RCT2 assets (design mode only): the
scenario defaults to a checked-in test park, feedback is the eval report
alone (no park screenshot), and the similarity penalty is inert because
there is no stock library to compare against.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are competing to design the best RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 roller coaster.
You submit a "track program": a ride type, a start tile, and an ordered list of track pieces.
The game engine builds it piece by piece, tests it with a real train, and rates it.

## Rules of track geometry
- Pieces chain sequentially from a cursor (position + facing direction). Each piece moves/rotates the cursor.
- The track must form a CLOSED CIRCUIT: the last piece must end exactly where the first begins, facing the same direction, at the same height. Total up-slope pieces must equal total down-slope pieces of the same steepness.
- A trick for closure: any identical piece sequence ending in a 90-degree turn, repeated 4 times, closes a rectangle.
- Start with begin_station, middle_station, end_station (station must be on flat ground, 3-7 pieces).
- up_25 rises 16 z-units per piece; up_60 rises 48. You cannot go below the starting height (the ground).
- Use {{"t": "up_25", "chain": true}} for chain lift hill pieces (needed to climb; trains start slow!). Chain lifts only work on 25-degree slopes, never on 60-degree pieces.
- Banking must be entered and exited: flat_to_left_bank ... left_bank ... left_bank_to_flat.
- Sloped pieces cannot be banked. Transitions matter: up_25 cannot follow flat directly, use flat_to_up_25.
- The train coasts on gravity after the lift. If it stalls (too little energy for a hill), the test fails or takes forever. Drops give speed; friction bleeds it.

## Ride types
{{RIDE_TYPE_LINE}}

## Scoring (from the real game engine)
Excitement is primary (higher wins). It rewards: drops, speed, airtime, direction changes, banked turns, length. Intensity above ~10 tanks excitement (guests won't ride); keep intensity under 10.00. Crashes disqualify.

Your track is also compared against the stock RCT2 track design library (mirrored variants included). Similarity up to 0.5 is free; above that your excitement is scaled down linearly, reaching zero for an exact copy. Design something original; reproducing a stock coaster from memory scores nothing.

## Piece catalog
{PIECE_CATALOG}

## Map
{{MAP_LINE}}

Before submitting, use the validate_track_program tool (same payload) to dry-run your program: it reports placement errors with the exact piece index, or whether the circuit closes, without spending your round. You get a limited number of validations per round, use them to fix geometry, then submit.

Submit via the submit_track_program tool. After each attempt you get the eval report (placement errors with exact piece index, or ride stats) and a park screenshot. Iterate and maximise excitement."""

LIBRARY_PROMPT = """

## Track design library
You can browse the stock RCT2 track design library before submitting:
- search_track_designs lists designs (name, ride type, piece count); filter with the ride_type parameter.
- get_track_design returns a design's full piece sequence in the same format you submit.
Use them to study proven layouts, then design your own. The similarity penalty applies to these exact designs, so copying (or mirroring) one scores zero; the winning move is understanding why they work and building something original with that knowledge."""
