//! Minimal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server over streamable HTTP.
//!
//! Hand-rolled on purpose: the protocol subset (initialize, tools/list,
//! tools/call) is small, and no async runtime is needed for it.
//!
//! The game API is strictly single-threaded, but I/O is not: sockets are read
//! and written on a thread per connection, and every request crosses one
//! channel to the game thread, which owns the session and is the only thread
//! allowed to touch the game. Tool calls still execute one at a time in arrival
//! order, so the simulation stays deterministic. Nothing reachable from a
//! connection thread may call `host::*`, the logger included.
//!
//! Two listeners, and which one a request arrived on decides what it can ask
//! for: the MCP listener is reachable from the agent sandboxes, the control
//! listener binds loopback for the harness. They dispatch against separate tool
//! tables, so a control tool is absent from the agent's world rather than
//! merely refused to it.
//!
//! Transport: POST /mcp with a JSON-RPC message, single JSON response
//! (the "streamable HTTP" JSON response mode). GET returns 405.
