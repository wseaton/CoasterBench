        r#"You are competing to design the best RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 {name} (ride_type {ride_type}).
This is round {round} of {rounds}. You build interactively through the "coaster" MCP tools:

- new_ride(ride_type, x, y, dir): start building; the cursor starts at that tile. Directions: 0 faces -x, 1 faces +y, 2 faces +x, 3 faces -y.
- place_piece(piece, chain?, speed?): place one piece at the cursor. Returns the new cursor and circuit_closed.
- place_pieces(pieces): batch placement; stops at the first rejection.
- valid_next_pieces(): which catalog pieces the game will accept at the current cursor. Ground truth - use it whenever unsure.
- piece_geometry(dir): exact cursor delta (tiles, z, direction, bank, slope) for every piece from a given direction. Use this to PLAN closure.
- undo_piece(): remove the last piece.
- get_state(): cursor, start, pieces placed, circuit_closed.
- finish_and_test(ticks?): places entrance/exit, runs a real test train, returns the full eval report with excitement/intensity/nausea.
- best_result(): the highest-excitement finish_and_test from this round so far. Your score is this, not your latest build.{screenshot}
- demolish(): tear down and start over (then new_ride again).

## Rules
- Build a CLOSED CIRCUIT: get_state must show circuit_closed before finish_and_test will pass.
- Start with begin_station, middle_station, end_station on flat ground (3-7 station pieces).
- Chain lift ({{"chain": true}}) only works on 25-degree slopes. Trains start slow; climb first, then coast.
- A `booster` accelerates the train up to its speed and `brakes` slows it down to theirs: {{"t": "booster", "speed": 25}}, 0-30, default 8. A booster is the fix for a layout that runs out of energy and valleys; brakes are for shedding speed before the station.
- Intensity above ~10 tanks excitement; keep it under 10. Crashes disqualify.
- {inversions}
- Your track is compared to the stock design library; similarity above 0.5 scales your score toward zero. Design something original.
- Map: flat grass around tile (60, 60); a lake sits roughly at tiles (68-85, 55-75) - do NOT build into it. Stay within tiles 20-120.

## How to work
1. Plan a layout, then new_ride and build with place_pieces in chunks.
2. On rejection, read the error, use valid_next_pieces/piece_geometry, fix, continue.
3. Close the circuit (watch cursor vs start in get_state; plan the return leg with piece_geometry).
4. finish_and_test as soon as you have a closed circuit, so you bank a score early.
5. Only then experiment: demolish and rebuild to beat it. A worse or unfinished rebuild costs nothing, because best_result keeps your highest score.
6. End with a one-line summary of your best coaster and its excitement.

## Budget
You have about {budget_mins} minutes of wall-clock this round, then the session is cut off.
Get a working, tested circuit banked EARLY; do not spend the whole budget on one perfect build.
Your score is your best finish_and_test of the round (see best_result), not your final build,
so it is always safe to stop once you are happy.
